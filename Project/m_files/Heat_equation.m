%% *The heat equation*
%% 1. Introduction
%% 
% # Let's assume a 1-dimensional rod with length $L>0$ made of an isotropic 
% material,
% # The function $T(x,t)$ describes the heat of a point $x$ at time $t$, $x 
% \in [ 0,L ]$, $t \in [0,\infty)$,
% # At $t=0$, the rod has some initial heat distribution $T(x,0) = \phi(x)$,
% # We assume no heat exchange with the enviornment.
%% 
% Knowing that, is there a way to know how the heat distribution in the object 
% changes over time? 
%% 2. Joseph Fourier's study of heat flow
% _The Analytical Theory of Heat_ (fr. _Th√©orie analytique de la chaleur_) is 
% Fourier's 1822 publication on heat flow. His work was based on Isaac Newton's 
% law of cooling, which states:
% 
% _*"The rate of heat loss of a body is directly proportional to the difference 
% in the temperatures between the body and its environment."*_
% 
% It is in this book where he famously stated, that any function can be expressed 
% as an infinite sum of sine waves, which led to the invention of the fourier 
% series and later, the fourier transform.
% The heat equation for 3 dimensions:
% $$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \cdot \left( \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial 
% x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2} \right)$$
% 
% which can also be generalized as:
% 
% $\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \cdot \nabla^2 T$ , where $\nabla^2$ 
% is the laplacian operator
%% 3. Methods used in my solution
% To solve the partial differential equation involved in this problem, I used 
% the _pdepe_ solver from the PDE toolbox, which can solve 1-D parabolic and elliptic 
% PDEs. 
%%
% 
%   sol = pdepe(m,pdefun,icfun,bcfun,xmesh,tspan)
%
%% 
% The term m is used to set either cylindrical (m=1) or spherical (m=2) symmetry. 
% In my case it was 0 for no symmetry and only one spatial dimension x.
% 
% 
% 
% pdefun is a vector containg everything needed to define the PDE itself, in 
% my case it's the output of the function heatpde, and the solver expects a PDE 
% given in this form:
% 
% $$c\left(x,t,u,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)\frac{\partial u}{\partial 
% x}=x^{-m} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\left(x^m f\left(x,t,u,\frac{\partial 
% u}{\partial x}\right)\right)+s\left(x,t,u,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)\ldotp$$
% 
% c is the constant that scales the time derivative, 
% 
% f is the function that we take the derivative of (we need the 2nd derivative 
% so x is set as dfdx)
% 
% s is any sources, which in this case is 0
% 
% 
% 
% icfun is the vector defining the initial conditions, here returned by the 
% function initial_conditions, which takes in all the parameters for the different 
% ICs available.
% 
% 
% 
% bcfun is the vector defining the boundary conditions, here returned by the 
% function boundar_conditions. The solver expects them in this form:
% 
% $$p\left(x,t,u\right)+q\left(x,t\right)f\left(x,t,u,\frac{\partial u}{\partial 
% x}\right)=0\ldotp$$
% 
% it allows setting Dirichlet (Constant temperature at boundary), Neumann(constant 
% heat flux at boundary) or mixed boundary conditions. In this program I only 
% included the first two.
% 
% 
% 
% xmesh and tspan are vectors containing the values of x along the rod, and 
% the points in time for the simulation to run respectively.  
% 
% 
% 
% After calculating everything I use figure functions such as set and drawnow 
% to create an animated graph of the solution changing over time
% 
% 
% 
% As for the 2-D case, I also used the PDE toolbox to first create a transient 
% thermal model using createpde, then I create a geometry consisting of 2 separate 
% geometries: a flat square plate and a circle in it's center which is the area 
% that starts at a highier temperature, and use decsg to decompose the geometry 
% matrix gd to the simplest form that satisfiers the condition sf. Ater that, 
% I assign the thermal model the geometry using geometryfromedges. I set all thermal 
% parameters to 1 for simplicity, set a 0 heat flux boundary condition on all 
% edges, and an initial condition for the 2 regions, the inner being 10K and the 
% outer 0. Then I use generateMesh on the model to create the points required 
% for the FEM analysis. The last step is using the solve function on the model 
% with a given vector of time values and graphing all the temperature values and 
% how they change with time on the animated graph.
%% 4. Heat flow in a 1-dimensional rod
% Let's first look at a simplified example with a 1-dimensional rod insulated 
% at both ends (No heat lost to the enviornment) and with an initial heat distribution 
% $\phi (x)$

% Controls for constant value

constant_temperature = 0;
% Controls for discontinuous

left_side_temperature = 0;
right_side_temperature = 1000;
discontinuity_point = 5;
% Slice selection

x_step = rod_length/(rod_length*length_resolution);
slice_x_value = 5;
slice_x_value_index = find(position == slice_x_value,1);
